I have created a shopping list managing website with local user authentication. Please Follow the steps to deploy it in your own machine to expirience it.
1. Install Xampp Server and MySQL Workbench app.

   Shopping Login.html, 
   logout.html, 
   Shopping Signup.php, 
   Login Check.php,

4. Place all these file in "htdocs" Folder which is located in "C:\xampp".
5. Place the image files in a seperate folder named "Images" inside htdocs folder.
6. Now open the mySQL Workbench app and login with your credentials (later you have to change the default credentials in the php files to your original credentials).
7. Create a Database named "hackclub".
8. create a table named "signup" and add three coloumns namely "Username", "Password", "Email".
9. Execute queries and check whether the table and coloums are created or not.
